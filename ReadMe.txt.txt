The file with name "unicodetask1_renewed" is the improvised version of the task 1 file in previous repository that is "unicode task".
The task 1 is an overview of my profile that has been generated using purely HTML5 and CSS4.
It has been designed using try and error method and mathematics to arrange the inline blolcks on particular places and adjusting their sizes. 
The font-awesome icons have been used to make it more creative.
