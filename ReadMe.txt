The file with name "unicodetask1_renewed" is the improvised version of the task 1 file in previous repository that is "unicode task".
The task 1 is an overview of my profile that has been generated using purely HTML5 and CSS4.
It has been designed using try and error method and mathematics to arrange the inline blolcks on particular places and adjusting their sizes. 
The font-awesome icons have been used to make it more creative. 

The next file that is mobileresponsive.html is coded using flexbox in bootstrap 4.  
The previous file was coded without bootstrap CDN included and after including it for task 2 ,it was very difficult to arrange same things again and make it look same as "unicodetask1_renewed". So I coded the complete task again using bootstrap 4 but still its unable to make it look just like previous task. 

The third task "validation.html" includes javascript validation functions using regular expressions.
The javascript code includes functions for mobile number validation and email id validation.
Also, the contact part that is facebook name and instagram id are editable too.
